In the industrial sector like transportation, healthcare, smart cities and energy systems, this IOT technology will be important. However, there are many problems to be solved. One of the problems is that security must be guaranteed. For safe security, we are considering two privacy issues which are mostly encountered in the field of IOT that is device authentication and decentralized identifiers. To provide device authentication and decentralized identifiers, the Blockchain technology can be applied to. This paper survey the related work for device authentication and decentralized identifiers in the IOT.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Information Technology}, pages = {147–153}, numpages = {7}, keywords = {Blockchain, device authentication, Internet of things, security, decentralized identifiers}, location = {Seoul, Republic of Korea}, series = {DSIT 2019} }

The traditional IAM systems, which focus solely on managing people's digital identities, fail to accommodate billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The emerging concepts such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) provide new perspectives on incorporating IAM capabilities into IoT ecosystems. In this paper, we present a decentralized IAM framework for IoT named DIAM-IoT, which is able to create a unified, interoperable, and tamper-proof device identity registry on top of the blockchain by introducing DIDs and VCs into the lifecycle of IoT devices, thereby breaking IoT application silos and unlocking the potential of IoT on a global scale. A proof-of-concept implementation of the DIAM-IoT framework for decentralized and user-centric data authorization demonstrates its feasibility and effectiveness in practice.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Symposium on Blockchain and Secure Critical Infrastructure}, pages = {186–191}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {decentralized identity, internet of things, identity and access management, verifiable credential}, location = {Taipei, Taiwan}, series = {BSCI '20} }
